/**
 * This interface defines an API for a VideoSvc. The
 * interface is used to provide a contract for client/server
 * interactions. The interface is annotated with Retrofit
 * annotations so that clients can automatically convert the
 * interface into a client capable of sending the appropriate
 * HTTP requests.
 * 
 * The HTTP API that you must implement so that this interface
 * will work:
 * 
 * GET /video
 *   - Returns the list of videos that have been added to the
 *     server as JSON. The list of videos does not have to be
 *     persisted across restarts of the server. The list of
 *     Video objects should be able to be unmarshalled by the
 *     client into a Collection<Video>.
 *     
 * POST /video
 *   - The video data is provided as an application/json request
 *     body. The JSON should generate a valid instance of the 
 *     Video class when deserialized by Spring's default 
 *     Jackson library.
 *   - Returns the JSON representation of the Video object that
 *     was stored along with any updates to that object. 
 *     --The server should generate a unique identifier for the Video
 *     object and assign it to the Video by calling its setId(...)
 *     method. The returned Video JSON should include this server-generated
 *     identifier so that the client can refer to it when uploading the
 *     binary mpeg video content for the Video.
 *    -- The server should also generate a "data url" for the
 *     Video. The "data url" is the url of the binary data for a
 *     Video (e.g., the raw mpeg data). The URL should be the *full* URL
 *     for the video and not just the path. You can use a method like the
 *     following to figure out the name of your server:
 *     
 *     	private String getUrlBaseForLocalServer() {
 *		   HttpServletRequest request = ((ServletRequestAttributes) RequestContextHolder.getRequestAttributes()).getRequest();
 *		   String base = "http://"+request.getServerName()+((request.getServerPort() != 80) ? ":"+request.getServerPort() : "");
 *		   return base;
 *		}
 *     
 * POST /video/{id}/data
 *   - The binary mpeg data for the video should be provided in a multipart
 *     request as a part with the key "data". The id in the path should be
 *     replaced with the unique identifier generated by the server for the
 *     Video. A client MUST *create* a Video first by sending a POST to /video
 *     and getting the identifier for the newly created Video object before
 *     sending a POST to /video/{id}/data. 
 *     
 * GET /video/{id}/data
 *   - Returns the binary mpeg data (if any) for the video with the given
 *     identifier. If no mpeg data has been uploaded for the specified video,
 *     then the server should return a 404 status code.
 *     
 *     
 * The VideoSvcApi interface described below should be used as the ultimate ground
 * truth for what should be implemented in the assignment. If there are any details
 * in the description above that conflict with the VideoSvcApi interface below, use
 * the details in the VideoSvcApi interface and report the discrepancy on the course
 * forums. 
 * 
 * For the ultimate ground truth of how the assignment will be graded, please see 
 * AutoGradingTest, which shows the specific tests that will be run to grade your
 * solution.
