# Assignment 2 Covering Weeks 3-6

## Overview

This assignment will build on the ideas in the original video service to add OAuth 2.0
authentication of clients and the ability to "like" videos. To complete
this assignment, you must allow users to authenticate using the OAuth 2.0 Password Grant flow.
Once authenticated, users must be able to like/unlike videos, as well as search for videos
by name and duration. In addition, video data must be stored in a Spring Data JPA repository.

Finally, all communication must take place over https, port 8443. The code to setup HTTPS
on the embedded Tomcat instance is included in the Application class.

You should note that this assignment also requires concepts used in the first assignment, such
as request mapping and JSON marshalling in request/response bodies. 

## Warning

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU USE THE INCLUDED KEYSTORE IN A PRODUCTION APP!!!
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU USE THIS APP "AS IS" IN PRODUCTION!!!

## Running the Application

Please read the instructions carefully.

To run the application:

1. Right-click on the Application class in the assignment project->Run As->Java Application (the 
   application may try to start and fail with an error message - this is OK). If the application
   successfully starts, stop the application before proceeding to the next step.
2. (Menu Bar) Run->Run Configurations
3. Under Java Applications, select your run configuration for this app's Application class that
   was just created in step 1 (if you select the run configuration, it should list the assignment
   as the project name)
4. Open the Arguments tab
5. In VM Arguments, provide the following information to use the
   default keystore provided with the sample code:

   -Dkeystore.file=src/main/resources/private/keystore -Dkeystore.pass=changeit

6. Note, this keystore is highly insecure! If you want more security, you 
   should obtain a real SSL certificate:

   http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/ssl-howto.html
   
7. This keystore is not secured and should be in a more secure directory -- preferably
   completely outside of the app for non-test applications -- and with strict permissions
   on which user accounts can access it

## Instructions

First, clone this Git repository and import it into Eclipse.

This assignment tests your ability to create a web application that
allows clients to authenticate using the OAuth 2.0 Password Grant Flow.
Clients can upload video metadata (name, duration, etc.) once logged in, 
as well as like/unlike videos.

The test that is used to grade your implementation is AutoGradingTest
in the org.magnum.mobilecloud.integration.test package in src/test/java. **_You should use the
source code in the AutoGradingTest as the ground truth for what the expected
behavior of your solution is_.** Your app should pass this test without 
any errors. The test methods are annotated with @Rubric and specify
the number of points associated with each test, the purpose of the test,
and the videos relevant to the test. 

The HTTP API that you must implement so that this test will pass is as
follows:

POST /oauth/token
   - The access point for the OAuth 2.0 Password Grant flow.
   - Clients should be able to submit a request with their username, password,
      client ID, and client secret, encoded as described in the OAuth lecture
      videos.
   - The client ID for the Retrofit adapter is "mobile" with an empty password.
   - There must be 2 users, whose usernames are "user0" and "admin". All passwords 
     should simply be "pass".
   - Rather than implementing this from scratch, we suggest reusing the example
     configuration from the OAuth 2.0 example in GitHub by copying these classes over:
     https://github.com/juleswhite/mobilecloud-14/tree/master/examples/9-VideoServiceWithOauth2/src/main/java/org/magnum/mobilecloud/video/auth
     You will need to @Import the OAuth2SecurityConfiguration into your Application or
     other configuration class to enable OAuth 2.0. You will also need to remove one
     of the containerCustomizer() methods in either OAuth2SecurityConfiguration or
     Application (they are the exact same code). You may need to customize the users
     in the OAuth2Config constructor or the security applied by the ResourceServer.configure(...) 
     method. You should determine what (if any) adaptations are needed by comparing this 
     and the test specification against the code in that class.
 
GET /video
   - Returns the list of videos that have been added to the
     server as JSON. The list of videos should be persisted
     using Spring Data. The list of Video objects should be able 
     to be unmarshalled by the client into a Collection<Video>.
   - The return content-type should be application/json, which
     will be the default if you use @ResponseBody

     
POST /video
   - The video metadata is provided as an application/json request
     body. The JSON should generate a valid instance of the 
     Video class when deserialized by Spring's default 
     Jackson library.
   - Returns the JSON representation of the Video object that
     was stored along with any updates to that object made by the server. 
   - **_The server should store the Video in a Spring Data JPA repository.
   	 If done properly, the repository should handle generating ID's._** 
   - A video should not have any likes when it is initially created.
   - You will need to add one or more annotations to the Video object
     in order for it to be persisted with JPA.

GET /video/{id}
   - Returns the video with the given id or 404 if the video is not found.
     
POST /video/{id}/like
   - Allows a user to like a video. Returns 200 Ok on success, 404 if the
     video is not found, or 400 if the user has already liked the video.
   - The service should should keep track of which users have liked a video and
     prevent a user from liking a video twice. A POJO Video object is provided for 
     you and you will need to annotate and/or add to it in order to make it persistable.
   - A user is only allowed to like a video once. If a user tries to like a video
      a second time, the operation should fail and return 400 Bad Request.
     
POST /video/{id}/unlike
   - Allows a user to unlike a video that he/she previously liked. Returns 200 OK
      on success, 404 if the video is not found, and a 400 if the user has not 
      previously liked the specified video.
      
GET /video/{id}/likedby
   - Returns a list of the string usernames of the users that have liked the specified
     video. If the video is not found, a 404 error should be generated.

GET /video/search/findByName?title={title}
   - Returns a list of videos whose titles match the given parameter or an empty
     list if none are found.
    
GET /video/search/findByDurationLessThan?duration={duration}
   - Returns a list of videos whose durations are less than the given parameter or
     an empty list if none are found.	

 This assignment also requires that you store your data using a Spring Data Jpa Repository.
 This will make implementing the findByName and findByDurationLessThan functionality much 
 easier. 
      
 The AutoGradingTest should be used as the ultimate ground truth for what should be 
 implemented in the assignment. If there are any details in the description above 
 that conflict with the AutoGradingTest, use the details in the AutoGradingTest 
 as the correct behavior and report the discrepancy on the course forums. Further, 
 you should look at the AutoGradingTest to ensure that
 you understand all of the requirements. It is perfectly OK to post on the forums and
 ask what a specific section of the AutoGradingTest does. Do not, however, post any
 code from your solution or potential solution.
 
 There is a VideoSvcApi interface that is annotated with Retrofit annotations in order
 to communicate with the video service that you will be creating. Your solution controller(s)
 should not directly implement this interface in a "Java sense" (e.g., you should not have
 YourSolution implements VideoSvcApi). Your solution should support the HTTP API that
 is described by this interface, in the text above, and in the AutoGradingTest. In some
 cases it may be possible to have the Controller and the client implement the interface.
 
 Again -- the ultimate ground truth of how the assignment will be graded, is contained
 in AutoGradingTest, which shows the specific tests that will be run to grade your
 solution. You must implement everything that is required to make all of the tests in
 this class pass. If a test case is not mentioned in this README file, you are still
 responsible for it and will be graded on whether or not it passes. __Make sure and read
 the AutoGradingTest code and look at each test__!
 
 You should not modify any of the code in VideoSvcApi, AutoGrading, or AutoGradingTest. 

## Testing Your Implementation

To test your solution, first run the application as described above. Once your application
is running, you can right-click on the AutoGradingTest->Run As->JUnit Test to launch the
test. Eclipse will report which tests pass or fail.

To get an estimated score for your solution, right-click on AutoGrading (not AutoGradingTest) and
Run As->Java Application. The AutoGrading application will run AutoGradingTest and then print a
summary of the test results and your score to the Eclipse Console (Window->Show View->Console). 
The AutoGrading application will also zip all of your source code into a submission package that
you can submit to Coursera to receive your official grade. Note: each time that you run AutoGrading
it will create a separate zip file. Make sure that you choose the right zip file when submitting 
your assignment! All of the submission zip files are placed in the coursera-submission folder.

## Submitting Your Assignment

To submit your assignment, you must first run the AutoGrading application as described in the previous
step to create your submission zip file. Make sure that you take note of the name of the submission
package that is printed in the console to ensure that you submit the correct zip file. You should
submit the submission package that is generated in the coursera-submission folder as the 
"Output Submission". Leave the "Additional Submission" empty. 

After submitting  your solution to Coursera, your submission package will be sent to the auto-grading
servers. It may take a few minutes for a score to be assigned to your submission. Once the submission
is graded, a detailed score will be registered with Coursera.

Note: locally running the AutoGrading application DOES NOT submit your solution to Coursera and will
not be counted as a valid submission. The grade that you see when running the AutoGrading application
is an estimate of your grade only. You must correctly submit the solution to Coursera to receive an
official grade.

 
## Provided Code

- __org.magnum.mobilecloud.video.repository.Video__: This is a simple class to represent the metadata for a video.

  You must annotate this object properly in order for it to be stored in the JPA repository. The annotations
  that you may want to include are @Entity, @Id, @GeneratedValue, and @ElementCollection.

- __OAuth 2.0 Configuration Code from the Examples__: This code is available here:
    https://github.com/juleswhite/mobilecloud-14/tree/master/examples/9-VideoServiceWithOauth2/src/main/java/org/magnum/mobilecloud/video/auth
	
	You should ensure that you create the proper users and set the proper security on the various endpoints
	to match the specification. We could have just included this code, but we wanted to give you the choice
	of whether or not you used it. If you want to use it, please do so. If not, feel free to implement your
	own approach that meets the assignment specification.
	
- __SecuredRestBuilder__: This wrapper around the Retrofit library is used by the tests to construct a client
    that will automatically perform OAuth 2.0 authentication with a password grant before API methods are 
    invoked.

## Hints

- If you want to test your application without security (e.g., to add a simple request mapping
  and try it without OAuth), you will need to comment-out the following lines in the build.gradle
  file and then right-click on build.gradle->Refresh All:

```    
    compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security:${springBootVersion}")
    compile("org.springframework.security.oauth:spring-security-oauth2:2.0.0.RC2")
    compile("org.springframework.security.oauth:spring-security-oauth2-javaconfig:1.0.0.M1")
```  

- The examples in GitHub will be helpful on this assignment
- A valid solution is going to have at least one class annotated with @Controller
- There will probably need to be several different methods annotated with @RequestMapping to
  implement the HTTP API described
- It is unlikely that you will be able to use Spring Data Rest to complete the assignment due to
  differences in the responses provided by Spring Data Rest when adding new videos, etc.
- Any Controller method can take a Principal as a parameter to gain access/control over the 
  user who is currently authenticated. Spring will automatically fill in this parameter when your 
  Controller's method is invoked:
```java
        ...
        @RequestMapping("/some/path/{id}")
        public MyObject doSomething(
                   @PathVariable("id") String id, 
                   Principal p) {
         
         String username = p.getName(); 
         // Maybe you want to add this users name to 
         // the list of people who like a video
            ....       
        }
        
```
- The IDs must be of type long. The tests send long values to the server and will generate
  400 response codes if you use an int.
- If you get an error 400, you have incorrectly specified the parameter values that the method
  should accept and their mapping to HTTP parameters.
- There are multiple ways to implement most pieces of the application. Any solution that passes
  the tests will be given full credit.
- None of your Controllers or other classes should "implement VideoSvcApi" -- which is an interface
  that is only used to create a Retrofit client. None of your classes should look like this:
```java
        public class SomeClass implements VideoSvcApi // Don't implement this interface! 
        {
          ...
        }
```
