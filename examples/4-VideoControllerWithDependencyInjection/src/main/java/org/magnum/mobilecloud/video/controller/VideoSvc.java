/**
 * This simple VideoSvc allows clients to send HTTP POST requests with
 * videos that are stored in memory using a list. Clients can send HTTP GET
 * requests to receive a JSON listing of the videos that have been sent to
 * the controller so far. Stopping the controller will cause it to lose the history of
 * videos that have been sent to it because they are stored in memory.
 * 
 * Notice how much simpler this VideoSvc is than the original VideoServlet?
 * Spring allows us to dramatically simplify our service. Another important
 * aspect of this version is that we have defined a VideoSvcApi that provides
 * strong typing on both the client and service interface to ensure that we
 * don't send the wrong paraemters, etc.
